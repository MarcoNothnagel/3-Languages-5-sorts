# 3-Languages-5-sorts
this is a pretty fun project where I compared 5 sorting algorithms in Java, C++ and Python. the results are exported and used by the Python code to export everything into a super cool spreadsheet where all of the statistics are shown. I did this for a presentation in the last year of my BSc.

All of this is run by the run.bat file
